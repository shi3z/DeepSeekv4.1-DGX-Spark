# Changelog

What a version means here: this repository is not a library and nothing imports it. What
you depend on is **the defaults the recipe ships and the measurements taken on them**, so
a release is a measurement epoch — the configuration as it stood, and the figures that
belong to it.

- **MAJOR** — the measurement basis changes (different hardware, model or checkpoint).
- **MINOR** — a shipped default changes, or the recipe gains a capability. Your numbers move.
- **PATCH** — documentation, corrections, tooling. Your numbers do not move.

`./run.sh` and the container print the version they were launched from, and the image is
tagged with it: `ghcr.io/<owner>/deepseek-v41-flash-spark:<version>`. A `-wip` version means
exactly what it says: the defaults are not settled and the measurements are incomplete.

## 0.1.0-wip — 2026-09-10

**Work in progress, not a release.** The recipe serves, and the numbers it served at are
in [`RESULTS.md`](RESULTS.md), but the benchmark sweep is one row long, the container has
never been run, and nothing here has been repeated on a second day. This entry records
what exists on the day the engine first served and the container/documentation
scaffolding was added, so that the first real release has something to be a delta from.

Box: one DGX Spark class machine — NVIDIA GB10, `sm_121a`, 128 GB unified memory
(~121 GiB visible), 20 cores, one local NVMe — Ubuntu 24.04 / DGX OS, CUDA 13.

### What works

- **Phase 0 is complete.** Checkpoint layout, architecture notes and the public landscape
  survey in [`NOTES.md`](NOTES.md); the expert-routing tracer (`tools/expert_trace.py`,
  layer-streaming and resumable), the Engram row fetcher (`tools/engram_rows.py`,
  multipart HTTP ranges against the two 101 GB shards), the corpus builder and the
  coverage/LRU analysis (`tools/expert_stats.py`).
- **The full 40-layer routing histogram** over 10,760 teacher-forced tokens, in
  `results/trace-full-20260910/`. At ~4,500 resident experts (84.6 GB): 0.780 static
  coverage, 0.875 LRU hit per token, 0.796 per 6-token block.
- **The teacher-forced check of the pure-torch port**, all 40 layers plus the head: coding
  NLL 2.15 / top-1 63.8%, general NLL 3.41 / top-1 47.4%. A broken port would sit near 10%.
- **The engine runs.** `engine/` loads the real checkpoint and produces coherent greedy
  text: the arena + LRU + transient ring over `O_DIRECT` NVMe streaming
  (`engine/experts.py`), the chunked-prefill/decode-block model with caches
  (`engine/model.py`), Engram rows at serve time (`engine/engram.py`), and the generation
  loop with DSpark drafting and verification (`engine/v41_engine.py`).
- **The Triton FP4 grouped-MoE kernel** (`tools/fp4_moe.py`): 193–197 GB/s effective at
  decode sizes on GB10, relative error 4.4e-3 against the dequantised reference.
- **Chunk invariance.** `engine/model.py` is bit-exact under every chunking tested for
  sequences ≤ 512 tokens, including cache rollback after a 6-token speculative block.
- **The OpenAI-compatible server** (`server/app.py`, standard library only) with the
  thinking/effort mapping, `reasoning_content` streaming, DSML tool-call parsing and
  `x_engine_stats` on every response; 15 end-to-end tests against the mock engine.
- **The launcher and the harness**: `start.sh` / `stop.sh` with port and memory guards,
  `bench/bench.py` with the `x_engine_stats` medians.

### Added in this entry

- `Dockerfile` — arm64, `nvidia/cuda:13.0.2-devel-ubuntu24.04`, torch 2.13.0+cu130 from
  the PyTorch cu130 aarch64 index (which is also where the matching `triton` comes from),
  plus transformers / tokenizers / safetensors / numpy / sympy / huggingface_hub. No
  compile step: the only kernel is JIT-compiled on the box. The devel base rather than
  `-runtime` because Triton needs a `ptxas` that knows `sm_121a`, and
  `TRITON_PTXAS_PATH` points at the toolkit's.
- `compose.yaml` — loopback-only `127.0.0.1:8000`, `./models:/models` and
  `./results:/app/results`, `.env` pass-through, `ipc: host`, `memlock` unlimited, all
  GPUs, and `restart: on-failure:1` so a failing load can never loop the box.
- `run.sh` — `setup` / `serve` / `logs` / `stop` / `shell` / `bench` / `config`, reading
  the same `.env` as `start.sh`.
- `scripts/entrypoint.sh` — the container's `start.sh`: the same env knobs as
  `env.example`, the `MemAvailable` guard, and auto-discovery of the newest
  `results/trace-*/stats/coverage.json` to rank the warm start.
- `scripts/download-model.sh` — resumable `snapshot_download` of
  `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash`, with the 510 GB warning and a free-space check.
- `.github/workflows/image.yml` — build and push to GHCR on `v*` tags and on demand,
  `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, `docker/build-push-action`, GHA cache.
- `.dockerignore`, `VERSION`, `docs/` (install, architecture, openai-api, benchmarking,
  gotchas), this file and `CREDITS.md`.

### Known not to work

Everything in [`LIMITATIONS.md`](LIMITATIONS.md). The short version: the container image
has never been built or run; decode is NVMe-bound at 2.6–2.7 tok/s and nothing overlaps the
expert reads with compute; bit-exactness stops at 512 tokens; long context, concurrency and
model quality beyond teacher forcing are all unmeasured; and one benchmark row is not a
benchmark.

### Measured on it

Everything in [`RESULTS.md`](RESULTS.md), all of it on 2026-09-10 on one GB10 box with the
pool to itself. The headline row, at a 73.8 GB arena (3,926 slots, 25.6 % of the routed
experts) on the `code` workload with DSpark on and thinking off:

| load to `/health` | TTFT (62-token prompt) | decode | acceptance | expert hit rate | NVMe per token |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~90 s | 11.05 s | 2.68 tok/s | 3.03 | 0.830 | 0.92 GB |

Plus the load breakdown (§1), the teacher-forced agreement with the pure-torch port (§2,
within 0.03 nats), the DSpark spec-on/spec-off A/B (§3, greedy output token-for-token
identical), and the two performance bugs the A/Bs caught (§5).

**Benchmarks are work in progress.** One workload row (`code`) exists. `prose`, both
one-shot generations and every thinking-on run were stopped before they produced a number,
so there is no measured long generation and no thinking-mode figure in this repo at all.
The earlier bring-up figures in `NOTES.md` taken on a 20 GB debug arena (6.9 % of the
routed experts) are a measurement of that arena, not of the recipe — do not quote them.

## 0.3.0-wip — 2026-09-11

**The shipped default changes: keep 40 % of the routed experts, all resident in the 3-bit CB3
format.** Decode 16.6 → 19.0 tok/s and held-out loss −0.03 (code) / −0.17 (prose) nats against
the 0.2.0-wip default, on the same box (RESULTS.md v0.3.0-wip).

### Added
- `EXPERT_FORMAT=cb3` / `--expert-format cb3`: the resident arena holds 3-bit per-row codebook
  experts (`tools/cb3.py`, 14.45 MB each), packed on the GPU at warm start from the FP4 shards;
  decode runs the CB3 v3 Triton kernel (`tools/cb3_moe.py`, 182 GB/s of expert bytes, 0.79x the
  FP4 kernel's time per expert); prefill unpacks to FP4 codes and runs the FP4 kernel. Unit test
  `tools/test_cb3_moe.py`.
- `tools/fp8_linear.py::fp8_grouped_linear`: the `wo_a` projection runs from its stored FP8
  (`DSV41_WOA_FP8=0` restores the bf16 einsum).
- `tools/decode_attn.py`: fused decode attention (bf16 keys, fp32 softmax with the sink, two KV
  segments without a copy; `DSV41_FUSED_ATTN=0` restores the fp32 torch path).
- `tools/fp32_skinny.py`: split-K fp32 kernel for the Hyper-Connection mixing GEMMs
  (`DSV41_HC_KERNEL=0` restores `F.linear`).
- `--prune-select global` / `PRUNE_SELECT`: cross-layer keep-set ranking; measured worse than
  uniform on the held-out corpus (NOTES.md 2026-09-11 10:00) and left as a documented option.
- CUDA graphs per step segmented at the Engram layers (`DSV41_GRAPH_SEGMENTS=0` restores per-layer
  graphs; no measurable gain either way), pinned Engram staging (`DSV41_ENGRAM_PINNED=1`, off).
- LM head and DSpark Markov head loaded in their stored bf16 (`DSV41_HEAD_FP32=1` restores fp32).

### Changed
- Default configuration in `env.example`/`docs/install.md`: `PRUNE_KEEP=0.40 EXPERT_FORMAT=cb3`
  for a 128 GB box. Warm start is 183 s in this format (19 s for FP4).
- Verify step with everything resident: 168 → 147 ms (FP4, keep 31 %); RESULTS.md addenda 2.9-2.11.

### Measured on it
RESULTS.md v0.3.0-wip: 18.98 tok/s greedy decode, TTFT 9.81 s on a 1,806-token prompt, held-out
1.5384 / 3.2087 nats. Not measured: thinking-on in this configuration, 8k+ prompts in this
configuration, sampled A/B, the image end to end.

## 0.2.0-wip — 2026-09-11

**The model math fix and the resident pruned configuration.** Everything in 0.1.0-wip ran on a port
with a transposed Hyper-Connection residual mix; this tag fixes it and rebuilds the decode path.

### Fixed
- `tools/v41_ref.py::hc_post`: sum over the first index of `comb` (combᵀ · residual), as in the
  reference `Block.hc_post`. Teacher-forced coding loss 2.16 -> 1.37 nats; greedy output no longer
  stutters; DSpark acceptance 2.4 -> 3.75 on code. (commit bd24743, 2026-09-11 00:50)
- Transient prefill ring must hold a whole layer (>= 384) unless every routable expert is resident.

### Added
- `engine/fastdecode.py`: CUDA-graph decode path (per-layer graphs, host slot resolve between them),
  fused HC Sinkhorn Triton kernel (`engine/hc_sinkhorn.py`), bf16 head, masked fixed-length indexer.
  Verify step 436 -> 173 ms with everything resident.
- `tools/fp8_linear.py`: dense projections in stored FP8 (Triton, 1.9x bf16 GEMM at decode size);
  `v41_ref.dense()` dispatch; `DSV41_DENSE_FP8=0` restores bf16 copies.
- Pruned all-resident serving: `--prune-keep F` (router restricted to the top-F experts per layer by
  trace frequency, exactly those warm-started), `--prune-sweep` teacher-forced ladder,
  `--transient-slots`, `--keep-free-gb`, `--arena-gb` pinned sizing.
- `engine/codebook_sim.py`, `tools/cb3.py`, `tools/cb3_moe.py`: 3-bit per-row codebook expert format
  (simulation, packer, and a correct-but-slow kernel).
- `engine/diag_decode.py` (decode == prefill consistency, per layer), `engine/test_fastdecode.py`,
  `engine/profile_decode.py`, `engine/profile_fast.py`.
- Held-out corpus `corpus/heldout_corpus.jsonl` (sources in `corpus/heldout_sources/`).

### Measured (RESULTS.md §v0.2.0-wip)
keep 31 % resident: 12.9 tok/s at +0.07 / +0.19 nats; unpruned streaming 3.5 tok/s; full ladder there.

### Process
Conventions applied from this tag on: no benchmark sweeps (single decode numbers only); docs
append-only with dates and per-tag sections; credits limited to the model vendor, the author's other
Spark recipes and the toolchain.
