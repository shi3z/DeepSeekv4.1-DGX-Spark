# DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash on a single NVIDIA DGX Spark

Serve **DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash** — 510 GB on disk, 15,360 routed FP4 experts, Engram n-gram
memory, CSA2/CED sparse attention, a DSpark drafter — on **one** GB10 box (sm_121a, 128 GB
unified memory, ~121 GiB visible), at **full FP4 expert quality**, from a plain-PyTorch engine
with one Triton kernel.

The point of this recipe is the one thing no published source does:

> **Keep a measured hot set of FP4 experts resident and stream every miss off NVMe with
> `O_DIRECT`, so the quality is the checkpoint's and only the speed pays.**

Every other single-box approach to this model shrinks the weights until they fit. This one
does not shrink anything. What runs:

- **one GB10 / DGX Spark class box** — no tensor parallelism, no second machine;
- **full FP4 expert quality** — the checkpoint's own e2m1 experts, never requantised, never
  pruned;
- **a resident hot set + NVMe streaming** — a 73.8 GB arena holds 25.6 % of the routed
  experts, ranked by a measured 40-layer routing trace; the other 74.4 % are read from the
  shards on demand;
- **DSpark speculative decoding** — the checkpoint's own drafter, lossless (the target
  verifies every drafted token), worth 1.5x here;
- **an OpenAI-compatible API** — `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/models`,
  streaming, tools, thinking/effort;
- **Open WebUI-ready** — reasoning streams as `reasoning_content` and renders in the
  collapsible pane with no configuration.

## The numbers

### v0.3.0-wip (2026-09-11) — the shipped configuration today

`PRUNE_KEEP=0.40 EXPERT_FORMAT=cb3 ARENA_GB=90.5`: the top 40 % of routed experts per layer (by a
measured routing trace) stay routable and resident in a 3-bit per-row codebook format packed from
the checkpoint's own FP4 experts; the other 60 % are never read at serving time. Everything else
(attention, Engram, DSpark drafter, dense projections in stored FP8) is unchanged. One run each:

| | measured | where |
|---|---|---|
| decode, 200 greedy tokens, code prompt, thinking off | **18.98 tok/s** (DSpark acceptance 3.03) | [RESULTS.md v0.3.0-wip](RESULTS.md) |
| TTFT, 1,806-token prompt | **9.81 s** | same |
| held-out teacher-forced loss vs the full unpruned model | **+0.032 (code) / +0.020 (prose) nats** | same, and 2.4 |
| resident set | 6,160 experts = 89.0 GB (40.8 %) | same |
| warm start | 183 s (GPU packing) | same |

The full unpruned model with expert streaming remains available (`PRUNE_KEEP` empty) at
3.5-4 tok/s, NVMe-bound. The intro bullets above describe that original mode; the shipped default
since v0.2.0-wip prunes and, since this tag, re-packs the resident experts to 3 bits.

### v0.1.0-wip (2026-09-10) — the original streaming mode (kept for the record)

**Measured 2026-09-10**, one GB10 box (128 GB unified / 121 GiB visible, 1 local NVMe,
Ubuntu 24.04 / DGX OS, driver 580.173.02, CUDA 13) with the unified pool to itself. Exact
config: `MAX_SEQ=32768`, `SPEC=1`, thinking **off**, arena auto-sized to **73.8 GB = 3,926
slots = 25.6 % of the 15,360 routed experts**, warm start ranked by
`results/trace-full-20260910/stats/coverage.json`, kernel `triton-fp4`, activation quant off,
`bench/bench.py --workload code --runs 2 --osl 512 --ignore-eos` (temperature 0.6, top_p 0.95,
every run exactly 512 completion tokens).

| | measured | where |
|---|---|---|
| load, process start to `/health` | **~90 s** (63 s non-expert weights + 14 s warm start, 66.3 GB at 4.7 GB/s) | [RESULTS.md §1](RESULTS.md) |
| TTFT, short prompts | **~7–11 s** (6.8 s on a 6-token prompt, 11.05 s median on the 62-token `code` prompt) | [§4](RESULTS.md) |
| decode | **2.64–2.71 tok/s**, median **2.68** (1.75 with DSpark off) | [§3, §4](RESULTS.md) |
| DSpark acceptance length | **~3.0** (3.03 median; 3.71 greedy on a 16-token prompt) | [§3, §4](RESULTS.md) |
| expert hit rate | **~0.83** (0.771–0.834 across runs) | [§3, §4](RESULTS.md) |
| NVMe read per generated token | **~0.9 GB** (0.92 GB) | [§4](RESULTS.md) |
| correctness vs the pure-torch reference port | NLL **+0.006 / +0.026 nats**, top-1 slightly *better* | [§2](RESULTS.md) |
| greedy speculative vs greedy autoregressive | **64 of 64 tokens identical**, first divergence `None` | [§3](RESULTS.md) |

That is 15–30x slower than the same model on four DGX Sparks with every expert resident, and
the reason is not a mystery: at a 25.6 % resident set the engine streams 0.92 GB of expert
weights per generated token, and the NVMe delivers ~2.5 GB/s at the read sizes a decode step
produces. Attention, the Engram lookups and the Triton MoE kernel together are **under 8 % of
decode time**. Everything else is the SSD.

## Benchmarks: work in progress

There is **one** workload row. `prose`, both one-shot generations and every thinking-on run
were stopped before they produced a number, so this repo contains **no measured evidence of a
long (thousands of tokens) generation and no thinking-mode figure at all**, `results/oneshots/`
is empty, and long context (8k+ prompts) has never been attempted at serving time. The table
above is what exists; [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md) lists every planned row that does not.

Do not quote the early bring-up figures in [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) either — they were taken on a
20 GB debug arena (6.9 % of the routed experts) and are a measurement of that arena, not of
this recipe.

Take your own rows against a running server:

```bash
python3 bench/bench.py --workload code  --runs 2 --osl 512 --ignore-eos --out results/code.json
python3 bench/bench.py --workload prose --runs 2 --osl 512 --ignore-eos --out results/prose.json
```

Every row carries the engine's own `x_engine_stats` — expert hit rate, NVMe GB, Engram rows,
acceptance length, the attention/MoE split — because on a recipe that streams most of its
weights, **a tok/s number without the hit rate and the GB that produced it is an anecdote**.
The four rules the harness refuses to break are in [`bench/README.md`](bench/README.md).

## Why it is built this way

The routed experts are 15,360 × 3 × 2304 × 5120 = 543.6 B weights, which at FP4 + UE8M0/32 is
**288.8 GB**. After ~18.5 GB of non-expert weights and a few GB of KV, one 121 GiB box has
**~85–90 GB left for experts** — an average of **~1.3 bits per weight** if everything must be
resident. Nothing meets a Q4-class quality floor at 1.3 bpw: even with every cold expert at
2.0 bpw only ~9 % could stay at FP4, and the whole set at 2.0 bpw is still 136 GB. So an
all-resident scheme is arithmetically dead, and the only quality-preserving single-box design
left is a resident hot set at native FP4 plus NVMe streaming for the rest.

Whether that works is decided by the routing coverage curve, so it was measured rather than
assumed — the full 40-layer histogram over 10,760 teacher-forced tokens
(`results/trace-full-20260910/`, built by `tools/expert_trace.py` one 7.4 GB layer shard at a
time):

| resident experts | GB (FP4) | static coverage | LRU hit / token | LRU hit / 6-token block |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3000 | 56.4 | 0.670 | 0.805 | 0.681 |
| **4000** | **75.2** | **0.748** | **0.855** | **0.764** |
| 5000 | 94.0 | 0.810 | 0.891 | 0.822 |
| 6000 | 112.8 | 0.859 | 0.917 | 0.865 |

The served config sits at 3,926 slots and the hit rate the engine actually reports is 0.830 —
close to the 4,000-slot per-token prediction, which is the one place where a design number and
a serving number can be checked against each other. The full arithmetic, the per-layer
skew, the category-specific hot sets (coding and general top-25 % sets overlap by a Jaccard of
only 0.18–0.31) and the whole design log are in [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) §0.6–0.8 and §B.

## Two ways to run it

Both are the same server and both read the same `./.env` (copy [`env.example`](env.example)).
[`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md) compares them and lists the host prerequisites — GB10 /
`sm_121a`, a CUDA 13 driver, ≥ 600 GB free on **local NVMe**, and the box essentially to
itself.

### Native — a venv on the box (this is the path every number above came from)

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install torch==2.13.0+cu130 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
pip install "transformers>=4.57" "tokenizers>=0.21" "safetensors>=0.5" numpy sympy huggingface_hub

cp env.example .env                  # set MODEL_DIR and PYTHON
MODEL_DIR=./models/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash ./scripts/download-model.sh    # 510 GB, resumable
./start.sh                           # nohup server/app.py --engine v41; waits for /health
./start.sh --no-wait                 # start and return; tail logs/server.log yourself
./stop.sh                            # SIGTERM -> SIGKILL -> wait for the memory to come back
```

`triton` arrives as a dependency of `torch` from the cu130 index and must not be replaced with
a PyPI build — the FP4 MoE kernel is JIT-compiled against whichever Triton is installed.

`start.sh` refuses to start if the port is taken or if less than `MIN_FREE_GIB` (90) is
available, and names the processes and containers holding the pool. The health wait is 20
minutes on purpose: the warm start fills the resident FP4 expert arena from NVMe *before* the
socket is bound, ranked by the newest `results/trace-*/stats/coverage.json` it can find. A
server that is not answering at minute 5 is normal.

### Container — compose or `run.sh`

```bash
cp env.example .env
./run.sh setup     # pull ghcr.io/<owner>/deepseek-v41-flash-spark:<version>, then download the weights
./run.sh serve     # detached; waits for /health
./run.sh logs
./run.sh stop
```

> **The image is untested.** `Dockerfile`, `compose.yaml`, `run.sh` and
> `scripts/entrypoint.sh` are written and `docker compose config` resolves, but **no image has
> been built or run yet** — the first build is the arm64 GitHub Actions job
> ([`.github/workflows/image.yml`](.github/workflows/image.yml)) on a `v*` tag, and nothing has
> served a request from a container. Until that lands, use the native path. `BUILD=1 ./run.sh
> setup` builds it on the box instead of pulling.

The image is arm64 only — the wheels are aarch64 and the box is a GB10, so there is no manifest
list. `compose.yaml` publishes the API on `127.0.0.1` only, mounts the checkpoint at `/models`
and `./results` at `/app/results`, and sets the three flags that are not optional (`--gpus
all`, `--ipc=host`, `--ulimit memlock=-1`). **Do not set `--memory`**: on unified memory that
caps GPU allocations too and the arena auto-sizer will quietly shrink to fit it.

### Check it is alive

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/health | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What is 2+2?"}],"max_tokens":64}'
```

`GET /health` carries `engine_config` — arena GB and slots, resident-expert %, `max_seq`, spec
on/off, trace stats, kernel — and every completion carries `x_engine_stats` with the same
fields plus that request's acceptance length, hit rate, NVMe GB and Engram rows. A benchmark
never has to be *told* how the server was started.

## Open WebUI (or any OpenAI client)

| setting | value |
|---|---|
| Base URL | `http://<host>:8000/v1` |
| API key | anything non-empty; it is not checked |
| Model | `deepseek-v4.1-flash` (whatever `SERVED_MODEL_NAME` says) |
| Streaming | on |

In Open WebUI: **Settings → Connections → add an OpenAI-compatible connection** with that base
URL. The model appears by its served id.

**Reasoning** is streamed as `reasoning_content` (text before `</think>`; the marker itself is
never emitted), which is the DeepSeek/OpenAI convention Open WebUI, LibreChat and the `openai`
Python SDK already understand — the thinking shows up in the collapsible pane with no
configuration.

**Thinking is OFF by default** (`DEFAULT_THINKING=off`). V4.1's template is not a binary
switch: thinking is on or off *and* there is an effort budget 1–100 rendered as a `Reasoning
Effort: N` system prefix. To turn it on for one request, any of these work — first match wins:

```jsonc
{"chat_template_kwargs": {"thinking": true}}   // unambiguous; what bench/bench.py sends
{"enable_thinking": true}                      // vLLM/SGLang convention
{"reasoning_effort": "high"}                   // OpenAI convention -> thinking on, effort 75
```

`reasoning_effort` maps `none`→off, `low`→off/50, `medium`→on/60, `high`→on/75, `xhigh`→on/90,
`max`→on/100, and a bare integer 1–100 → on at that integer. Open WebUI's own *Reasoning
Effort* control sends the top-level field, so setting it to `medium` or higher turns thinking
on by itself. Change the default for every request with `DEFAULT_THINKING=on` /
`DEFAULT_EFFORT=90` in `.env`.

Two expectations to set before anyone else points a client at it:

* **The first token can take minutes on a cold prompt.** Prefill misses almost every expert and
  each miss is an 18.8 MB NVMe read. Raise the client-side request timeout to tens of minutes.
* **One request at a time.** The engine is single-sequence; a second caller does not get an
  error, they get a wait. There is no authentication and the port is loopback-only — put a
  reverse proxy in front of it before it leaves the box.

Full API reference: [`docs/openai-api.md`](docs/openai-api.md) (operator's view) and
[`server/README.md`](server/README.md) (every flag and field).

## Reproduce the checks and the trace

Neither needs a server; both need the checkpoint and an interpreter with torch.

```bash
# the engine's math against the pure-PyTorch reference port (RESULTS.md §2)
python3 engine/v41_engine.py --model-dir ./models/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash --act-quant \
    --teacher-forced corpus/trace_corpus.jsonl --tf-out results/tf.json

# DSpark on/off/sampled from one load, and where the two greedy runs diverge (RESULTS.md §3)
python3 engine/v41_engine.py --model-dir ./models/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash --spec-ab \
    --max-tokens 64 --temperature 1.0 --ab-out results/spec_ab.json

# the HTTP layer, against the mock engine -- no GPU, no weights, tokenizer metadata is enough
python3 server/test_server.py
```

The routing trace that ranks the warm start, one 7.4 GB layer shard at a time (resumable, so
it can run while the rest of the checkpoint is still downloading):

```bash
python3 tools/make_corpus.py   --tokenizer ./models/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash --code ... --prose ... \
    --out corpus/trace_corpus.jsonl
python3 tools/engram_rows.py   --model-dir ./models/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash \
    --corpus corpus/trace_corpus.jsonl --out engram_rows
python3 tools/expert_trace.py  --model-dir ./models/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash \
    --corpus corpus/trace_corpus.jsonl --engram-dir engram_rows \
    --out results/trace-YYYYMMDD --layers 0-39 --resume
python3 tools/expert_stats.py  --trace results/trace-YYYYMMDD --out results/trace-YYYYMMDD/stats
```

Tracing needs the layer shards (`model-0000{3..42}-of-00048.safetensors`), `model-00002`
(embed), the checkpoint's `inference/` folder and the tokenizer — but **not** the two 101 GB
Engram shards: `tools/engram_rows.py` pulls only the rows the corpus touches over multipart
HTTP range requests. Serving needs all of it.
